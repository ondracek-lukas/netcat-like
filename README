Usage:
  ./netcat [-q] ADDRESS PORT
  ./netcat [-q] -lp LOCAL_PORT [-s LOCAL_ADDRESS]
  ./netcat [ -q | -v[v] ] -x ADDRESS PORT1[:PORT2]

The first variant works as a client connecting to the given address and port.
The second as a server listening on the given port.
The third tries to connect to the address and port (or port range)
and prints opened ports.

Argument -v increases verbosity, -q decreases.
